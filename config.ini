description="A regular guy from a universe far from Aether and a sapling from the deep forests of Aether join forces to save the Aetherian Forest. Joshua & Batit is ready to kick some butt (and Batit).\nSome vocabulary before you read:\nBatitful - state when Batit is not placed on ground, determined when the hud shows when Batit can be placed\nBatitless - state when Batit is placed or is dead, determined when the hud is dark\nNudge - when Batit is hit by Joshua, a hitbox is created around it, cancels into attacks\n\nJoshua & Batit is an aggressive fighter. Its main gimmick is Batit. Think of Maypul's Down-B but very interactable.\nBatitful Down Special:\n-places Batit on ground, your main gimmick\nUp Attack & Side Attack (Batit)\n-Both send a projectile in their respective direction.\n-Can be inputted during any action.\n-If Joshua uses the corresponding move, hold the attack button until the 6th frame of the move in order to make Batit also do their respective attack.\n-The above can be toggled on and off by pressing taunt and attack at the same time at any point during a match. The top light on the hud indicates whether this option is on or off.\nStrongs\n-When in the Batitful state, Joshua has access to larger strongs (Up and Forward Strongs) feat. Batit. \n-When in the Batitless state, Joshua has 2 small-range strongs (Down strong and Grounded Down Special). However, Batit gains access to Joshuaâ€™s missing Strongs (Forward and Up Strong).\n-Down Strong is the same whether you are in the Batitful or Batitless state.\n-At this point you may have asked, "
info1="Joshua's main gimmick is his dspecial, Batit. You can move Batit by nudging him with attacks, or pick him up with fspecial."
info2="Batit can fire projectiles with fattack, uattack, and nspecial. Also, he has an ustrong and fstrong. These can be used anytime."
info3="When Batit is out, some moves are changed, these include strongs and specials, so be sure to always balance out your gameplay!"
